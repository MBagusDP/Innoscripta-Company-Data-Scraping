# Innoscripta-Company-Data-Scraping
Competition where we are asked to scrape as many companies details as possible from a specific country that we are assigned to, with a time duration of a month

Our team are assigned to scrape data from Canada, we managed to get the company which arrange this competition to get us an account for a website that we are scraping
called platform.globaldatabase.com. From there we utilize Selenium in pythong to scrape the companies details inside the website and store it in Google Sheet

The other team member are working on setting up postgresql database to move all the data from Google Sheet to a proper database. Google Sheet here is used as a bridge to connect us who are from different part of time zones to enables us to work in parallel
